# Quantum EEG Simulation with GPU & Mixed Precision Optimization

## üìå Introduction
### **Motivation & Inspiration**
The human brain exhibits **coherent oscillatory activity** across multiple spatial and temporal scales, forming what is observed as **EEG brainwaves**. These oscillations show remarkable self-organizing properties, coherence over long ranges, and fractal-like behaviors. Traditional models of EEG activity rely on **classical neural mass models**, but emerging evidence suggests that neural coherence phenomena bear striking **analogies to macroscopic quantum systems** such as **high-temperature superconductors** and **turbulent flows**.

This project is inspired by:
1. **Scale Relativity Theory** ‚Äì which provides a fractal spacetime structure to describe neural wavefunction dynamics.
2. **Pointer States in Quantum Mechanics** ‚Äì EEG oscillations are modeled as stable quantum-like states that persist in neural dynamics.
3. **Long-Range Fractal Networks** ‚Äì The brain's functional connectivity follows a scale-free, log-normal distribution akin to long-range correlations in complex systems like superconductors and turbulence.

By leveraging these principles, we formulate EEG dynamics using a **modified Schr√∂dinger equation**, incorporating an **effective neural potential $V_{	ext{eff}}(x,y,k,t)$** and a **macroscopic quantum potential (MQP) $Q_{	ext{macro}}(x,y,k,t)$** to model long-range coherence in brain oscillations.

## üî¨ **Mathematical Foundations**
### **1. Schr√∂dinger-Like Evolution of EEG Oscillations**
To describe neural activity propagation, we use a **quantum-inspired wavefunction** $\Psi(x,y,r,t)$, evolving according to a modified Schr√∂dinger equation:

$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{D}{2} \nabla^2 \Psi + (V_{\text{eff}} + Q_{\text{macro}}) \Psi
$$

where:
- $\Psi(x,y,k,t)$ is the **neural wavefunction** on a **cortical grid**.
- $D$ is the **macroscopic diffusion constant** modeling neuronal excitability.
- $\nabla^2 = \nabla^2_x + \nabla^2_y + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial k^2}$ includes **spatial and synaptic connectivity derivatives**.
- $V_{\text{eff}}$ represents the **effective excitation-inhibition potential** governing cortical interactions.
- $Q_{\text{macro}}$ is the **macroscopic quantum potential** enforcing large-scale coherence.

### **2. The Role of Scale Relativity in EEG Dynamics**
Scale Relativity (SR) extends classical physics by treating space and time as **fractal at small scales**, leading to stochastic and quantum-like dynamics in complex systems like the brain. Using SR principles, we derive a generalized neural diffusion equation with:

An **effective potential** is derived from **neuronal excitation and inhibition interactions** and can be expressed in its continuous form as an **integral over synaptic interactions**:

$$
V_{\text{eff}}(x,y,k) = \int \int W_{\text{eff}}(x, y, x', y', k) |\Psi(x',y',k)|^2 \, dx' \, dy'
$$

where:
- $W_{\text{eff}}(x,y,x',y',k)$ represents the **continuous synaptic connectivity kernel**, governing excitation-inhibition interactions across the cortical surface.
- $|\Psi(x',y',k)|^2$ is the **neuronal activation probability density**, describing how activity propagates through synaptic interactions.
- $k$ encodes the **hierarchical inhibition-excitation balance**, influencing large-scale neural dynamics.

To implement $V_{\text{eff}}$ in a computationally efficient manner, we discretize the integral over the cortical grid **using a summation over neuronal sites**:

$$
V_{\text{eff}}(x,y,k) \approx \sum_{i', j'} W_{\text{eff}}(x, y, i', j', k) |\Psi(i',j',k)|^2
$$

where:
- The integral has been **approximated as a sum** over **discrete cortical sites** $(i', j')$.
- $W_{\text{eff}}(x, y, i', j', k)$ is now treated as a **log-normal distributed weight matrix**, encoding neuronal connectivity in a fractal network.
- This **discrete formulation** enables efficient computation, particularly when using **Monte Carlo sampling** to approximate long-range interactions.

**Key Role:**  
$V_{\text{eff}}$ **stabilizes neural oscillations, enforces frequency coupling, and encodes external task loads**, ensuring that EEG frequency bands emerge as stable eigenstates of the system.


The **macroscopic quantum potential** enforces **global neuronal coherence and EEG quantization**:

$$
Q_{\text{macro}} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\nabla^2 |\Psi|}{|\Psi|}
$$

where:
- $Q_{\text{macro}}$ **emerges from scale relativity** and **prevents uncontrolled decoherence**.
- The **second derivative of probability density** $\frac{\nabla^2 |\Psi|}{|\Psi|}$ ensures **self-organization of EEG modes**.
- **Large-scale cortical activity behaves like a resonant quantum-like system**.

**Key Role:**  
$Q_{\text{macro}}$ **introduces EEG frequency quantization, enforces large-scale coherence, and helps model brain-state transitions**.

## **4 Log-Periodicity of Neuronal Connections**
The **log-periodic structure** of neuronal connectivity emerges from **fractal organization of synaptic weights**. This follows a **log-normal distribution**:

$$
P(W) \sim \frac{1}{W} e^{-\frac{(\log W - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
$$

where:
- $W$ is the **synaptic weight**.
- $\mu$ and $\sigma$ define the **log-normal statistical structure** of neuronal connections.

üîπ **Key Implications:**
1. **Neuronal connectivity is neither fully random nor uniform but follows a log-periodic structure.**
2. **This fractal organization is responsible for EEG 1/f power-law scaling.**
3. **Log-periodicity introduces discrete EEG frequency bands, analogous to quantum energy levels.**

üìå **Why This Matters:**  
- **EEG power spectra exhibit a fractal 1/f distribution, suggesting scale-invariance in brain activity.**
- **The log-periodic correction in synaptic interactions leads to EEG frequency quantization.**
- **This structure supports hierarchical information processing and task-induced coherence.**

## **5 The Role of the scaling variable $k$ in EEG Simulation**
‚úÖ **From the perspective of Scale Relativity,$k$ serves as an additional coordinate in the fractal space of neural activity**
‚úÖ **$k$ represents the synaptic connectivity hierarchy, encoding long-range neuronal interactions**  
‚úÖ **$k$ introduces a structured connectivity space, influencing how EEG modes form and stabilize.**  
‚úÖ **$k$-dependent Laplacian terms regulate neuronal coherence, affecting EEG frequency band separation**  
‚úÖ **The Macroscopic Quantum Potential integrates $k$-dependent effects, ensuring global EEG synchronization.**

## **6 Biological Basis for Boundary Conditions**

### Thalamocortical Filtering and Sleep-Wake Transitions
The boundary conditions in our model are inspired by the **role of the thalamus** in regulating cortical activity. The thalamus acts as a **sensory gate**, dynamically controlling how much neural energy flows between the cortex and the rest of the nervous system. This process directly influences **EEG wave coherence** and can be mathematically represented as a modulation of **wavefunction boundary absorption**.

- **Wakefulness:** The thalamus allows significant sensory input and energy dissipation, preventing large-scale cortical synchronization. This is modeled using **absorbing boundary conditions**, ensuring **localized wave propagation**.
- **Deep Sleep (NREM 3-4):** The thalamus **blocks external input**, forcing the cortex into an **isolated resonance state**, leading to **large, synchronized slow waves (0.5-4 Hz)**. This is effectively modeled by **reducing absorption**, allowing EEG waves to behave as in a **resonant cavity**.
- **REM Sleep:** The thalamus partially reopens, allowing **internally generated bursts of activity**, leading to theta waves (4-8 Hz) with intermittent desynchronization. This corresponds to **intermediate absorption strength**.

### Mathematical Representation of Boundary Conditions
We define a **dynamic absorption mask** that smoothly transitions between these states:

 $$
 A(x, y, r, t) = \exp\left(-\left(\lambda_0 - \lambda_s S(t)\right) \left( \frac{x^2}{L_x^2} + \frac{y^2}{L_y^2} + \frac{r^2}{L_r^2} \right) \right)
 $$

where:
- $\lambda_0 = 0.95$ is the default absorption factor in **wakefulness**.
- $\lambda_s = 0.4$ modulates absorption strength based on sleep state.
- $S(t)$ is a **sleep factor** that transitions smoothly from 0 (wake) to 1 (deep sleep).
- $(L_x, L_y, L_r)$ are characteristic cortical grid scales.

This function controls **how much energy remains inside the cortex** vs. **how much is dissipated into the nervous system**.

### Implementation in Schr√∂dinger Evolution
We apply this dynamic boundary condition in the wavefunction update step:

 $$
 \Psi_{t+1} = \Psi_t + dt \left( -D \nabla^2 \Psi_t + (V + Q_{\text{macro}}) \Psi_t \right) \cdot A(x, y, r, t)
 $$

This ensures that **energy remains trapped inside the cortex during sleep**, leading to large-scale EEG oscillations, while **wakefulness allows interaction with the rest of the nervous system**, preventing global coherence.

This biologically motivated boundary model provides a natural explanation for EEG transitions without requiring discrete switching between boundary conditions.
