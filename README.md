# Quantum EEG Simulation with GPU & Mixed Precision Optimization

## üìå Introduction
### **Motivation & Inspiration**
The human brain exhibits **coherent oscillatory activity** across multiple spatial and temporal scales, forming what is observed as **EEG brainwaves**. These oscillations show remarkable self-organizing properties, coherence over long ranges, and fractal-like behaviors. Traditional models of EEG activity rely on **classical neural mass models**, but emerging evidence suggests that neural coherence phenomena bear striking **analogies to macroscopic quantum systems** such as **high-temperature superconductors** and **turbulent flows**.

This project is inspired by:
1. **Scale Relativity Theory** ‚Äì which provides a fractal spacetime structure to describe neural wavefunction dynamics.
2. **Pointer States in Quantum Mechanics** ‚Äì EEG oscillations are modeled as stable quantum-like states that persist in neural dynamics.
3. **Long-Range Fractal Networks** ‚Äì The brain's functional connectivity follows a scale-free, log-normal distribution akin to long-range correlations in complex systems like superconductors and turbulence.

By leveraging these principles, we formulate EEG dynamics using a **modified Schr√∂dinger equation**, incorporating an **effective neural potential $V_{	ext{eff}}(x,y,r,t)$** and a **macroscopic quantum potential (MQP) $Q_{	ext{macro}}(x,y,r,t)$** to model long-range coherence in brain oscillations.

## üî¨ **Mathematical Foundations**
### **1. Schr√∂dinger-Like Evolution of EEG Oscillations**
To describe neural activity propagation, we use a **quantum-inspired wavefunction** $\Psi(x,y,r,t)$, evolving according to a modified Schr√∂dinger equation:

 $$
 i \hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = \left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} (\nabla_{xy}^2 + \partial_r^2) + V_{\text{eff}}(x,y,r,t) + Q_{\text{macro}}(x,y,r,t) \right] \Psi
 $$

where:
- **$x, y$** are spatial cortical coordinates.
- **$r$** represents an **inhibition-excitation balance parameter**, encoding hierarchical neural states, synaptic conductance variations, and cross-frequency coupling effects.
- **$\nabla_{xy}^2 \Psi$** models the diffusion-like propagation of neural activity across the cortical sheet.
- **$\partial_r^2 \Psi$** governs transitions between **nested frequency bands** and excitation-inhibition states.
- **$V_{\text{eff}}(x,y,r,t)$** represents **log-normal distributed synaptic connectivity**, forming a complex neural landscape.
- **$Q_{\text{macro}}(x,y,r,t)$** is a **quantum-like potential** that stabilizes large-scale EEG coherence, analogous to quantum fluid dynamics.

### **2. The Role of Scale Relativity in EEG Dynamics**
Scale Relativity (SR) extends classical physics by treating space and time as **fractal at small scales**, leading to stochastic and quantum-like dynamics in complex systems like the brain. Using SR principles, we derive a generalized neural diffusion equation:

$$
 i D \frac{\partial \, \Psi}{\partial t} = -D^2 (\nabla_{xy}^2 + \partial_r^2) \Psi + V_{	ext{eff}}(x,y,r,t) \Psi + Q_{	ext{macro}}(x,y,r,t) \Psi
$$

where:
- **$D$** is a fractal diffusion coefficient governing neural excitability.
- The **fractal nature of neural activity** influences phase coherence in EEG oscillations.

### **3. Macroscopic Quantum Potential (MQP) & Long-Range Coherence**
In **superconductivity**, a macroscopic quantum potential **stabilizes Cooper pairs**, preventing decoherence. In EEG, we propose a similar mechanism where an MQP **stabilizes phase coherence in large-scale oscillations**:

$$
 Q_{\text{macro}}(x,y,r,t) = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\nabla_{xy}^2 \sqrt{|\Psi(x,y,r,t)|^2}}{\sqrt{|\Psi(x,y,r,t)|^2}} + \beta \sum_j W_j(x,y) \nabla_{xy}^2 |\Psi_j(x,y,r,t)|^2
$$

where:
- **$|\Psi(x,y,r,t)|^2$** represents the neural wave density, encoding excitation-inhibition balance.
- The **first term** is a Bohmian quantum potential, enforcing coherence.
- The **second term** models **log-normal synaptic connectivity**, ensuring long-range fractal coherence.
