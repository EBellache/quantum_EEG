# **Quantum EEG Simulation**
üöÄ **Exploring the Quantum-Like Nature of Brainwaves using Macroscopic Quantum Hydrodynamics**

Brainwaves‚ÄîDelta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma‚Äîgovern cognition, perception, and consciousness, yet their fundamental nature remains unclear. Are they merely classical oscillations, or do they reflect a deeper quantum-like principle of bioelectric coherence? Is sleep a self-organizing process that restores coherence, and can this process be externally modulated to influence cognition and bioelectric systems?

## **üìå Project Overview**
This project aims to **simulate the emergence of quantized EEG frequency bands** using **quantum-inspired hydrodynamic equations** in a **fractal cortical network**. Leveraging **Scale Relativity Theory**, **log-normal neural connectivity**, and **JAX-based numerical methods**, we investigate whether EEG bands are the result of a **quantization principle** rather than classical oscillations.

### **üî¨ Key Scientific Questions**
1. Are **EEG bands** merely classical oscillations, or do they reflect an **underlying quantum-like principle**?
2. Can **scale relativity** and **fractal cortical networks** explain **EEG frequency quantization**?
3. Is **sleep** a self-organizing process that **restores macroscopic quantum coherence** in the brain?
4. Can we **simulate large-scale EEG coherence** using **macroscopic quantum hydrodynamics**?

## **üßë‚Äçüî¨ Scientific Background**
### **Macroscopic Quantum Hydrodynamics & EEG**
- **Macroscopic Quantum Potential (MQP)** explains why EEG bands appear as **quantized modes**.
- Cortical networks are **fractal** and follow a **log-normal connectivity pattern**.
- Sleep may restore **quantum coherence** by reorganizing EEG states.

### **Euler-Schrodinger Hydrodynamic Equations**
Instead of solving the classical Schr√∂dinger equation:

$$
i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \psi + V \psi
$$

we use its **hydrodynamic representation**:

#### **1. Continuity Equation (Conservation of Probability Density)**
The probability density \( \rho = |\psi|^2 \) evolves according to:

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) = 0
$$

where \( \mathbf{v} \) is the velocity field given by:

$$
\mathbf{v} = \frac{\nabla S}{m}
$$

with \( S \) being the phase of the wavefunction.

#### **2. Euler-Like Equation (Quantum Force Balance)**
The velocity field obeys a modified Euler equation:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{v} = -\frac{1}{m} \nabla V - \frac{1}{m} \nabla Q
$$

where:
- $V(x, y, s)$ is an **external neural potential** (e.g., synaptic inputs, neurotransmitter fields).
- $Q(x, y, s)$ is the **Macroscopic Quantum Potential (MQP)**.

#### **3. Macroscopic Quantum Potential (MQP)**
The MQP is derived as:

$$
Q = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\nabla^2 \sqrt{\rho}}{\sqrt{\rho}}
$$

This term plays a crucial role in stabilizing **coherent EEG states**, ensuring that frequency bands form **discrete, quantized modes**.

### **Neural Connectivity and Fractal EEG Structures**
- Cortical networks **do not have uniform connectivity** but follow a **log-normal distribution**.
- Synaptic strengths between neurons are highly **skewed**, meaning **a few strong connections** dominate **a sea of weak ones**.
- This leads to the **self-organization of EEG bands** into **fractal, scale-dependent structures**.

Using **Scale Relativity Theory**, we propose that EEG bands are **not arbitrarily defined** but emerge from **quantized neural oscillatory states**.

---

### **Sleep and Quantum Coherence Restoration**
- Sleep is hypothesized to act as a **reset mechanism**, reorganizing EEG states.
- The presence of **slow-wave sleep (SWS) and REM cycles** suggests that **EEG coherence is periodically restored**.
- In this framework, **sleep acts as a macroscopic process that maintains neural coherence by shifting probability distributions in scale space**.
